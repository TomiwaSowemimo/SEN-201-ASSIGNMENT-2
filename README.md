1. Project Overview
Project Name: EstateFlow
Concept: A commercial web-based platform designed to showcase luxury real estate properties. The goal of this project is to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for potential homeowners to browse listings.

2. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
For the development of EstateFlow, I followed the SDLC phases to ensure the project was well-structured and met user requirements.

Phase 1: Planning & Requirement Analysis
Objective: To create a digital presence for a real estate brand.
Requirements: The site must have a bold brand identity, a navigable menu, a visual catalog of properties, and a way for users to connect via social media.
Nomenclature: Established the core brand name as EstateFlow.

Phase 2: System Design
Architecture: A three-file structure consisting of HTML (Structure), CSS (Style), and JavaScript (Logic).
UI/UX Design: Planned a "Card-based" grid layout for property listings to ensure clarity and visual appeal.
Naming Conventions: All CSS classes (e.g., .property-grid, .card, .logo) were designed to match the professional nature of the brand.

Phase 3: Implementation (Coding)
Frontend: Developed using HTML5 for semantic structure.
Styling: Utilized CSS3 with Flexbox and Grid systems to create the responsive property layout.
Interaction: Integrated JavaScript to handle dynamic elements like the auto-updating copyright year.
Library Integration: Linked Font Awesome to provide professional iconography for the footer.

Phase 4: Testing
Verification: Tested the links and button interactions (JavaScript alerts) to ensure they respond correctly to user input.
Visual Check: Verified that the "EstateFlow" branding is consistent across the header, body, and footer sections.

Phase 5: Deployment
Version Control: The project was initialized as a Git repository and pushed to GitHub for hosting and review.

3. Implementation Details
The following files represent the final implementation of the design:

index.html: Contains the site structure and the EstateFlow brand elements.
style.css: Contains the "Graphically Appealing" styles, including button-style navigation and grid layouts.
script.js: Handles functional interactions and dynamic footer data.
